# Dompanine Box

## A personal "to do" app that helps user achieve personal goals and experince activities as instrinsically rewarding 

*An intrinsic component of the human condition that drives behavior is a sense of meaning in oneâ€™s actions.*

The concept of this app was based off a youtube video by Mike Boyd who built a physical "dopamine box" that gives a very phsyical feedback of a light changing from "red" to "green" when he completes his daily tasks. In his youtube video he talks about how he is more likley to complete tasks if, when a task is done, it gives him some form of reward sensation, ie the light changes from "red" to "green".

The Dompanime Box App allows users to create a daily task list. 
A user will be asked to set a daily goal with the *Daily Goal* link on the nav bar to set how many tasks they would like to complete for that day.

The uncompleted tasks show in pink bold text with *Done* and *Remove* buttons along side.
Once the user has completed the task it will cross out and change color to blue. This action will update the goal completion. 
When the user has completed the number of tasks that match thier goals for that day, a message with *Well done! You rock!* will pop up.
Users can check the status of how many tasks they compeleted on a day. 


## technologies used
 
    express; mongoose; mongoDB; react; heroku

## challenges

Being able to have the user be able to see thier "stats" for how many days they were able to complete goals and then this link to the goal message on the index page. 

## futher development ideas
* Have a better looking signup/ login page
* Add media queries so can use on phone/table
* remove the login/signup from nav bar once user has logged into app
